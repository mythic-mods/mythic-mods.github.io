## Wabbajack Installation

Create a new folder named `Wabbajack` in a top-level location that is not <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.uac}}">UAC</a> protected in the same way you setup your Steam Library in previous steps.
* For example: `G:\Wabbajack\`

On the [Wabbajack] homepage, click the `Download` button to download Wabbajack.
* Move the downloaded `Wabbajack.exe` into the `Wabbajack` directory you previously created.
* Double-click `Wabbajack.exe` to launch the application.
* When launched, Wabbajack will automatically update and download into the `Wabbajack` directory.


## Mythic Skyrim Installation

You can now install Mythic Skyrim through Wabbajack:
* Click the `Browse Modlists` button in the Wabbajack tool.
* In the Wabbajack Gallery, find the Mythic Skyrim modlist and click the arrow button to start the download process.
* In the installation window, you will need to define two folders:
	* Installation Location is where Mythic Skyrim will be installed to.
		* Choose a high-level folder such as `G:\Mythic Skyrim\` that is outside <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.uac}}">UAC</a> protected folders.
	* Download Location is where the downloaded mod archives will be stored.
		* By default, they will be placed within your main Mythic Skyrim folder, but you can change the file path if you want to keep the files elsewhere.
* Once both folder locations have been set, click the button on the right to begin the installation process. 


### Nexus Mods Downloads

If you have a [Nexus Mods] Premium account, Wabbajack will automatically download and install the mods on the website for you.

If you only have a free account, Wabbajack will open the mod pages and guide you through the process of downloading the files.
Afterwards, it will proceed with the installation as usual.

{% include tip.html content="A Nexus Premium account is highly recommended." %}


### Installation Process

As Wabbajack downloads the modlist, previews will be displayed of the mods being installed.
Unless the installation is aborted completely, you donâ€™t have to worry about any warnings.
You will be prompted when the installation process is complete.


### Troubleshooting Installation

In the case of a failed installation: restart Wabbajack. You will not lose progress as the tool will pick up where it left of.
You can find all Wabbajack logs in your Wabbajack installation folder under `\Wabbajack\logs\`.
