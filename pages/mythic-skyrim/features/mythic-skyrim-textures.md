## Overview

Mods like: Texture Pack Combiner, Special Edition Texture Overhaul Guide, Skyrim Mod Combiner, and similar mods have attempted this in the past. All of which have since been abandoned.

Over the many years and hundreds of hours of testing and comparing various mods, {{ site.skyrim-project }} has continued this cathedral-style approach to visual overhauls.

In addition to including many custom or edited textures and meshes exclusive to the {{ site.skyrim-project }} modlist; {{ site.skyrim-project }} has individually hand-picked textures and meshes from virtually every texture mod, pack, and overhaul available. This includes mods on Nexus as well as many other sites. It also includes texture mods for both LE and SE, since they are generally cross-compatible.

However, {{ site.skyrim-project }} *does not* mindlessly throw overhauls on top of each other and call it a day. Instead, the absolute best textures have been pulled from each individual mod and reconstructed into something new. In some cases, {{ site.skyrim-project }} may only use a handful of the best textures from an overhaul mod that contains hundreds.

These textures and meshes have been thoroughly compared on the individual asset level, with the best being recombined into a seamless and coherent custom visual experience wholly unique to {{ site.skyrim-project }}. The visual overhaul found in {{ site.skyrim-project }} is the culmination of hundreds of mods, from dozens of artists, together working thousands of hours for more than 10 years.

See below for a list of just some of the cornerstone artists and mod authors that have contributed. Please endorse, donate, or leave comments of support for their contributions to Skyrim modding.
