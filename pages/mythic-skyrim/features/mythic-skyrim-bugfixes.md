## USSEP
[Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches]
This is a bundle of patches to fix the bugs in the Skyrim Creation Club content as well as resolve conflicts between Creation Club mods and the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP).

Click this link to view the updated and complete [USSEP Changelog].


## SKSE Required Fixes
It is important to note that USSEP does not make any fixes that would require SKSE. For fixes that require SKSE, a collection of mods are listed below.

You can search to see if a particular bug from the vanilla game not addressed by USSEP has been addressed by another mod in the search bar below.

The purpose of this table is to ensure there are no redundancies or conflicts in included vanilla bugfixes, without needing to crosss-reference many mod page descriptions.
