## Overview

{{ site.skyrim-project }} includes a full collection of vanilla game bugfixes. This page focuses on core gameplay and engine fixes made by USSEP and various included SKSE plugins.

For bugfixes related to meshes and textures, see [Visual Overhaul](mythic-skyrim-visuals.html).

For general UI improvements and fixes see [User Interface](mythic-skyrim-interface.html).  


## USSEP

[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch] (USSEP) fixes hundreds of gameplay, quest, NPC, object, item, text and placement bugs with the goal to eventually fix every bug with Skyrim Special Edition not officially resolved by the developers to the limits of the Creation Kit and community-developed tools. Click this link to view the updated and complete [USSEP Changelog].

[Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches] (USCCCP) is a bundle of patches to fix the bugs in the Skyrim Creation Club content as well as resolve conflicts between Creation Club mods and USSEP.

{{ site.skyrim-project }} integrates and supports all Creation Club content. Care was taken to ensure other mods integrated into the modlist remained USSEP compatible.

It is important to note that USSEP does not make any fixes that would require SKSE. For fixes that require SKSE, consult the table below.


## SKSE Fixes

There are many bugs in the vanilla game that require SKSE to be resolved.

You can search to see which bugs from the vanilla game are addressed by SKSE plugins, as well as the source mod for the fix, in the table below.

The purpose of this table is to ensure there are no redundancies or conflicts with vanilla bugfixes made by SKSE plugins, without needing to cross-reference many mod page descriptions.
