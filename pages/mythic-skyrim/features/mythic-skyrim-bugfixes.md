Actor Value Percentage	                | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes incorrect values being displayed in the HUD for player and NPC actor values (health, stamina, etc.) due to the target having any temporary buffs or debuffs to the relevant actor value.

Harvested Flags                         | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes flora and trees that have respawned in a loaded from being incorrectly harvested once again. This is an alternative to the Flora Respawn Fix.
Hit Effect Race Condition               | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes race condition from preventing hit effects being applied to an actor if their mesh loads after a magic effect is first updated.

Mod Armor Weight Perk Entry Point       | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes the Mod Armor Weight perk entry point from not modifying the weight of just the armor you are wearing, but incorrectly modifying the weight of stacks of that armor.
Quick Shot                              | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes the Quick Shot perk not being accounted for when calculating the power of an arrow fired by the player.
Terrain Decals                          | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes decals not being applied to the terrain in cells that have been partially unloaded.
Training Menu Text                      | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes the cost of a lesson displayed in the training menu not being affected by any buffs or debuffs to the relevant skill.
Weapon Charge                           | Scrambled Bugs    | Fixes the charge of equipped enchanted weapons only being restored to the charge they were when last equipped or recharged.
