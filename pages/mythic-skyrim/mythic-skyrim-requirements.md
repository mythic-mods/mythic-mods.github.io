## Disk Space

Mythic Skyrim currently requires ~??GB of free disk space for modlist installation (MO2 mods folder) and another ~??GB for the initial downloaded archives (MO2 downloads folder).

{% include tip.html content=
"It is recommended to install Mythic Skyrim on an SSD.
The initial installation process will be faster if the downloaded archives are also on an SSD." %}

{% include tip.html content=
"The downloaded archives are not necessary for gameplay but keeping them will reduce the time required to update the list.
If you need to free up SSD space after installation, the downloaded archives can be moved to a different drive." %}

{% include warning.html content=
"If you delete the downloaded archives, you will have to redownload the mods when updating the modlist." %}


## Visual C++ Redistributable

[Microsoft Visual C++] Redistributable is a basic package required by Mod Organizer 2 and typically ships with Windows.
* Download and run the [vc_redist.x64.exe] installer.
* The application will guide you through the installation process.


## Microsoft .NET 5.0

[.NET 5.0 Runtime] framework is required for certain mods. The game will not launch if you do not have it installed.
* Download and run the [Desktop App x64] installer.
* The application will guide you through the installation process.


## Update GPU Drivers

This is more of a recommendation than a hard requirement, but if you encounter any unexpected performance issues or graphical artifacts it is usually recommended to update your GPU drivers as a first step in troubleshooting.
* It is highly recommended to update GPU drivers before continuing.
* You can find the latest drivers for your GPU on the manufacturers website ([NVIDIA] or [AMD])
