---

## General Requirements
* [Skyrim Anniversary Edition] on Steam
* Latest version of Windows 10 (required by Wabbajack)
* [Nexus Mods] account (Premium recommended)
* Latest drivers for your GPU ([NVIDIA] or [AMD])

## Disk Space
Mythic Skyrim currently requires ~??GB of free disk space for the list installation and another ~??GB for the downloaded archives.
It is recommended to install Mythic Skyrim on an SSD.

The initial installation process will be faster if the downloaded archives are also on an SSD.
They can be moved to a different drive afterwards as they are not necessary for gameplay, only for updating the list.
If you delete them, you will have to redownload them if you want to update so itâ€™s recommended to keep them.

## Visual C++ Redist
The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is a basic package required by Mod Organizer 2 and typically ships with Windows.
You probably already have it installed with Windows but it is best to make sure.
* Open the official [Microsoft Visual C++] website.
* Scroll to the Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 section.
* Download the following file: [vc_redist.x64.exe].
* Run the executable, it will guide you through the installation process.

## Microsoft .NET 5.0
Additionally, .NET 5.0 is required for certain mods. The game will not launch if you do not have it installed.
* Open the official [.NET 5.0 Runtime] website
* Download and run the [Desktop App x64] installer
