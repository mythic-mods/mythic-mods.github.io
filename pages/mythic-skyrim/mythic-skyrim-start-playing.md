## Launching the Game
Navigate to your Mythic Skyrim folder and launch `ModOrganizer.exe`.
In the top right drop-down menu, ensure `Mythic Skyrim` is selected and launch the game by clicking `Run`.
> Mythic Skyrim uses the "Stock Game Folder" system. There are no Game Folder Files to move manually.
