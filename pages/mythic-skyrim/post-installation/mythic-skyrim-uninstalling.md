## Uninstalling the Modlist

Uninstalling the modlist is as simple as deleting the `Mythic Skyrim` folder you installed the modlist to.
With the modlist using a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.stock_game_folder}}">Stock Game Folder</a> system
in combination with the VFS of Mod Organizer 2, the integrity of the root game directory is not compromised.


## Uninstalling Wabbajack

To uninstall Wabbajack, run the `uninstall.bat` file located in the root `Wabbajack` folder you installed the tool to.
