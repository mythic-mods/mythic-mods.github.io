## Game Folder Files
Mythic Skyrim uses a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.stock_game_folder}}">Stock Game Folder</a> system.
There are no Game Folder Files to move manually. The stock game files include the following for convenience:
* Cleaned master files
* Cleaned Creation Club content
* Pre-installed SKSE (with configured ini files)
* Preset ENB
* Various tools with relative paths to the game directory
* Other dlls required by various mods

## Launching the Game
Navigate to your Mythic Skyrim folder and launch `ModOrganizer.exe`.
In the top right drop-down menu, ensure `Mythic Skyrim` is selected and launch the game by clicking `Run`.

## MCM Instructions
<a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.mcm}}">MCM</a> menus for Mythic Skyrim have been pre-configured.

There are some settings and optional mods available for the user to customize. See Customization for more information.
It is strongly recommended to not change MCM settings to anything other than what is discussed on the Customization page.
